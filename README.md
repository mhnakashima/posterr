### More Details

**Users**

- Only alphanumeric characters can be used for username
- Maximum 14 characters for username
- When/if necessary to make your application function, you may hard-code the default user. For example, you may need to do this to implement creating new posts from the home page, following, etc

**Posts**

Posts are the equivalent of Twitter's tweets. They are text-only, user-generated content. Users can write original posts and interact with other users' posts by reposting or quote-posting. For this project, you should implement all three â€” original posts, reposts, and quote-posting

- Users are not allowed to post more than 5 posts in one day (including reposts and quote posts)
- Posts can have a maximum of 777 characters
- When writing a post, a user should see how many characters he has left
- Users cannot update or delete their posts
- Reposting: Users can repost other users' posts (like Twitter Retweet)
- Quote-post: Users can repost other user's posts and leave a comment along with it (like Twitter Quote Tweet)

**Following**

- Users should be able to follow other users
- Users cannot follow themselves
- Following and unfollowing will be done only on the user profile page

### Extra **feature: Search**

Only work on this extra feature if you have enough time to complete the required features and get through all three phases of the test.

- Implement a search feature that allows users to efficiently search through all posts
- This search feature should not return reposts
- This search feature should return quote posts, but only if the search matches the additional text added (do **not** return matches from the original post that was quoted on top of)
- (For Phase 2) This search feature should return reply-to-posts
